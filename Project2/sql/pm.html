            <h2>PATTERN MATCHING</h2>
            <p>
                Pattern matching is checking whether a specific sequence of characters or token or data exist within a dataset. It is a primary feature of any data management language and is also implemented in SQL.<br>
                The LIKE operator is used with the WHERE clause.<br>
                It enables users to use _ to match a single character
                and % to match an arbitrary number of characters.<br>
                Pattern matching in MySQL is case-insensitive by default.<br>
                To make the pattern matching case sensitive in MySQL, the BINARY operator is used.
                <br><br>
                Syntax:<br>
                SELECT entry FROM data WHERE column LIKE 'pattern'; SELECT entry FROM data WHERE column NOT LIKE 'pattern';</p>
