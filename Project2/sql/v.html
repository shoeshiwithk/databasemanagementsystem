            <h2>VIEWS</h2>
            <p>Views in SQL are kind of virtual tables. A view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database. We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database. A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain condition. In this article we will learn about creating , deleting and updating Views</p>
            <p><span>CREATING VIEWS</span><br>
            We can create View using CREATE VIEW statement. A View can be created from a single table or multiple tables. <br>
            Syntax: <br>
            CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2..... FROM table_name WHERE condition;<br>
            view_name: Name for the View<br>
            table_name: Name of the table<br>
            condition: Condition to select rows<br>

                <span>DELETING VIEWS</span><br>
                We have learned about creating a View, but what if a created View is not needed any more? Obviously we will want to delete it. SQL allows us to delete an existing View. We can delete or drop a View using the DROP statement. <br>
                Syntax:<br>
                DROP VIEW view_name;<br>
                view_name: Name of the View which we want to delete.
