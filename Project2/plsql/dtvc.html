            <h2>DATA TYPLES, VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS</h2>
            <p>
                A variable is a meaningful name which facilitates a programmer to store data temporarily during the execution of code. It helps you to manipulate data in PL/SQL programs. It is nothing except a name given to a storage area. Each variable in the PL/SQL has a specific data type which defines the size and layout of the variable's memory.<br>
                <br>
                Syntax for declaring variable:<br>
                variable_name [CONSTANT] datatype [NOT NULL] [:= | DEFAULT initial_value]<br><br>
                <span>Initializing Variables in PL/SQL</span><br>
                Evertime you declare a variable, PL/SQL defines a default value NULL to it. If you want to initialize a variable with other value than NULL value, you can do so during the declaration, by using any one of the following methods.<br>
                The DEFAULT keyword<br>
                The assignment operator

                <br><br>
            <span>PL/SQL Constants</span><br>
                A constant is a value used in a PL/SQL block that remains unchanged throughout the program. It is a user-defined literal value. It can be declared and used instead of actual values.<br><br>
                Syntax to declare a constant:<br>
                constant_name CONSTANT datatype := VALUE;<br><br>
                Constant_name:it is the name of constant just like variable name. The constant word is a reserved word and its value does not change.<br>
                VALUE: it is a value which is assigned to a constant when it is declared. It can not be assigned later.<br>
